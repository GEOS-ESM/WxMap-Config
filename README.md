This repository is for managing configuration files used by WxMap. YAML is the primary configuration language. Directories and source files can be directly referenced by WxMap to produce visualizations. Please note that WxMap combines YAML files to simulate inheritance and overriding. Special conventions are sometimes employed within YAML as directives that reset and aggregate configurations. This is to promote software reuse.
